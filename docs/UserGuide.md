### Rationale

MediSaveContact is designed for nurses and healthcare workers who provide care outside traditional hospital settings. 
The application focuses on quick data entry and retrieval through a command-line interface, making it faster to manage 
patient information during busy schedules.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java 17 or above installed in your computer, following this [guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallation.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F14b-2/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your MediSaveContact.

1. For **Windows** users: Locate MediSaveContact in your file manager and double click on the application.<br>
   For **Mac/Linux** users: Open a command terminal, `cd` (change directory) into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar MediSaveContact.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   An application similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png) <br>

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `help` : Shows all commands available in the application.

   * `patient n/John Tan p/91234567 a/Blk 123 Clementi Ave 3 tag/high` : Adds a patient named `John Tan` to MediSaveContact.
   
   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [tag/TAG]` can be used as: 
  * `n/John Doe tag/High` ✅
  * `n/John Doe` ✅

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  * `n/John Doe tag/high` ✅
  * `tag/high n/John Doe` ✅

* Extra parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if you type `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.

* When a compulsory parameter is not provided, an error message regarding the missing parameter will appear, and the command will not be executed.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Exiting the program : `exit`

### Saving the data

MediSaveContact data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

MediSaveContact data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, MediSaveContact will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the application to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous MediSaveContact home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
